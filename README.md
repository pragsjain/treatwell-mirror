# UX/UI Challenge

v1.0

## Description

Thanks for taking the time to work on this project.

At the attached URL you can find a Figma board with some screens. The task is to implement a static version (no Backend needed) of these screens using React.

Starting from Screen 1, when the user scrolls the Header transitions to a fixed position on top as showed in Screen 2.

Also when the Search input is focused there is another transition to the dedicated "Search" view on Screen 3.

We are asking you to:

1. Add your code in this repository and open a Pull Request when you think you have finished.

2. Host your work somewhere on the web and add the link to the PR **OR** create a zip file with the static build of your project and attach it to the PR.

3. We'll look at the final results in the browser and at the structure of the code.
